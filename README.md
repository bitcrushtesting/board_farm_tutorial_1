In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up a board farm using Raspberry Pis for automated testing. Board farming involves using multiple embedded systems boards to automate and parallelize the testing process, which is essential for complex projects. 

This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up the hardware, writing the necessary scripts, and configuring a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. This tutorial will use Arduino Uno and Arduino UNO R4 minima boards as test hardware.
