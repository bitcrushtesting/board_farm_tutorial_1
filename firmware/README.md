# Blink Test Firmware

This example sketch will blink an LED on the Arduino board and send a message over the serial port. This simple test will allow you to verify that the board is functioning correctly and that the automated testing setup can communicate with the board.

## Explanation

* LED Control: The LED is toggled on and off every second.
* JSON-RPC Notification: A JSON-RPC notification is sent whenever the LED state changes, with the state being either "ON" or "OFF".
* Git Hash: The firmware includes a hard-coded Git hash (replace "abc123" with the actual hash during the build process).
* JSON-RPC Request Handling: The sketch listens for JSON-RPC requests over the serial port. It handles a getVersion method, responding with the firmware version and Git hash.

## Uploading the Firmware

Use the Python script provided earlier to upload this firmware to your Arduino boards as part of the automated testing process. Hereâ€™s how you can modify the upload_and_test.py script to check for the correct serial output.
